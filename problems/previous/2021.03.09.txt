Problem 1:

You are given a string containing multiple words. Your output is the same
string, except that each word has had its characters sorted.

Examples:
  Input: "hello world"
  Output: "ehllo dlorw"
  
  Input: "welcome back to green book club"
  Output: "ceelmow abck ot eegnr bkoo bclu"

Extensions: 
  How fast can you do this? What about if you are constrained to at-most 4
  different letters per word? Any number of repetitions are allowed, such as:
  
  Input: "green book club is so much fun"
  Output: "eegnr bkoo bclu is os chmu fnu"

Problem 2:

Given an M*N matrix of random integers some of which will be zero, zero-out any
row and column where a cell contains a zero. Try to do it in O(M*N) space and
O(M*N) time.

Extension:
Can you do this in O(1) space and O(M*N) time?

Examples:

  Input:  1 3 0 7 1 90
          7 8 3 1 3 17
          3 21 2 8 0 3
          1 14 11 3 4 8
  
  Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0
          7 8 0 1 0 17
          0 0 0 0 0 0
          1 14 0 3 0 8
  
  Input:  14 0 7
          8 0 31
          1 4 9
  
  Output: 0 0 0
          0 0 0
          1 0 9
