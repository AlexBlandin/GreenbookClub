  Problem 16
    Given an NxM matrix, describe an algorithm to search for a given value. The following properties hold for the matrix:

      1. Each row is comprised of integers sorted in ascending order (left to right)
      2. The first value on a given row is strictly greater than the last value of the row before it.

      For example, given

        1,   3,  5,  7
