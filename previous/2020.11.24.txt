Problem 1:

A magic index in an array of n integers (index from 0 to n-1) is defined to be
an index such that array[i] = i.

Part A:
  The array is unsorted, what is the most efficient algorithm that can be
  written (i.e. write an algorithm that takes O(_) time, and provide an argument
  why you can't go faster than O(_))

Part B:
  The list of integers is sorted in the array. Repeat Part A.

Problem 2:

Write a program to swap sequential pairs of odd and even bits in an integer with
as few operations as possible.
