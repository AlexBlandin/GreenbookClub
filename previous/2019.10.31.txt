	Problem 1:
		There is 100 doors in a dungeon. A prisoner, to survive, must execute the following algorithm:
			1. They open all doors. 
			2. They close every second door. 
			3. They toggle every third door, 

		The process continues, for 100 passes, such that for each pass n, the prisoner toggles every nth door;
		When the algorithm completes, the evil genius releases her monsters. 
		The monsters will come out of every open door. 

		Question A:
			How many monsters attack her poor prisoner?
	
		Question B:
			Our evil genius, likes to make abstract math a reality. She instead creates d many doors
			(where d is any natural number she pleases). 
			Given d many doors, and d many passes of the algorithm, express the number of monsters that
			attack their poor prisoner as a function f(d)
		
		Question C:
			Why is she tourchering the prisoner? (Feel free to elaborate, scary halloween storries welcome)

	Problem 2:
		Mix up in groups of first, second and third years (as possible) and tackle the following:
		Write a program to sort a stack with the smallest items on top.
		Recall that the allowed operations on a stack are: Push, Pop, Peek and isEmpty. 
	
		Question A:
			You are allowed to use exactly one aditional stack. How fast can you go?
		
		Question B:
			You are allowed to use as many additional stacks as you like. How fast can you go?


	Happy Haloween :-) Hopefully you won't be captured by the evil genious on your way out.
