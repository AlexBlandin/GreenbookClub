Problem 1
Given two strings s1, s2 where length(s1) < length(s2) find the index of the first instance where s1 is a substring of s2.

Example 1:
  Input:
    s1 = "abCd"
    s2 = "ffffabCdCOVID"
  Output: 4

Extension task:
  Extend this to return the index of all substrings of s1 in s2.
 

Problem 2
Given two strings: s1, s2 and a third string s3 such that length(s1) + length(s2) = length(s3) determine if you can interleave the characters in s1 and s2 to get to s3.

Example 1:
   Input: s1 = "aadcc", s2 = "beebt", s3 = "aabeedcbtc"
   Output: true

Example 2:
   Input: s1 = "aadcc", s2 = "xeebt", s3 = "aabeedcbtc"
   Output: false

This is a 2-part problem:
   Part A:
      No character in s1 appears in s2 and vise-versa

   Part B:
      No such restriction applies (i.e. s1 = "aabc", s2 = "aabf")
