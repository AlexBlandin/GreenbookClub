Problem 1:
	Given a list of daily temperatures, return a list such that, for each day in the input,
	tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. 
	If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

	Example:
		 Input:  [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
		 Output: [ 1,  1,  4,  2,  1,  1,  0,  0]

	Part B (AMENDED):
		Can you do this in linear time?

Problem 2:
	Given a matrix consisting of 0s and 1s, we may choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column.
	Flipping a cell changes the value of that cell from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.
	Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.

	Example 1:
		Input: [[0,1],[1,1]]
		Output: 1
		Explanation: After flipping no values, 1 row has all values equal.

	Example 2:
		Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]
		Output: 2
		Explanation: After flipping values in the first column, both rows have equal values.

	Example 3:
		Input: [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
		Output: 2
		Explanation: After flipping values in the first two columns, the last two rows have equal values.
