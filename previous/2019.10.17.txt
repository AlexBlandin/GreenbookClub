Problem 1:

Given an array A of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the
even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
 
Example:
  Input:  [3,1,2,4]
  Output: [4,2,1,3]

Extension 1:
  Your output array must now be composed of the even array in ascending order, 
  and the odd array in decending order
 
Example:
  Input:  [3,1,2,4,8,3,4,1]
  Output: [2,4,4,8,3,3,1,1]

Problem 2:

Given a 2D (binary) matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle
containing only 1's and return its area.
 
Example:
  Input: [[1,0,1,0,0],
          [1,0,1,1,1],
          [1,1,1,1,1],
          [1,0,0,1,0]]
  Output: 6
  Explanation: A 3*2 rectangle is formed starting at row 1, column 2 and ending in row 2 column 4.
