Problem 1:

Given any integer n in range (-2000000000,2000000000) (That is -2 bilion to +2 bilion), 
produce a string that represents it in natural English language.

Example 1:
  input  := 1234
  output := One Thousaind Two Hundred (and) Thirty Four
  
Example 2:
  input  := -92435
  output := Minus Ninety-two Thousaind Four Hundred (and) Thirty Five

Problem 2:

You have a computer that only 'knows' addition and negation of integers (E.g.
can turn -4 to 4 and 4 to -4)
 
Part A:
  Define subtraction using only the above two operations
 
Part B:
  Define multiplication using the above three operations
 
Part C:
  Define division using the above four operations.
 
Hint: You may not need all available operations for each part.
